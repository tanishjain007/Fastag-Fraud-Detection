# Fastag-Fraud-Detection

# Overview
Fast Tag Fraud Detection is a project designed to address and mitigate fraudulent activities related to fast tag systems in toll collection. The system leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data and identify suspicious patterns indicative of fraud.

# Key Features
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect anomalies and patterns associated with fraudulent fast tag transactions.

Real-time Monitoring: Enables real-time monitoring of fast tag transactions, allowing for swift identification and response to potential fraud.

User-friendly Dashboard: Provides a user-friendly dashboard for visualization of fraud detection results, allowing administrators to easily interpret and act upon the findings.

Customizable Rules: Allows customization of fraud detection rules based on specific requirements and characteristics of the toll collection system.

# How It Works
Data Collection: Gathers transaction data from fast tag systems, including details such as transaction amount, location, and timestamp.

Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from the transaction data, creating a dataset suitable for machine learning analysis.

Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train models on historical data, learning to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Real-time Analysis: Applies the trained models to real-time fast tag transactions, flagging any transactions that exhibit suspicious patterns.

Alerts and Reporting: Notifies administrators of detected fraud through alerts and provides comprehensive reports for further investigation.
